Eight employees at a small company were asked to choose 3 movies that they would most enjoy watching for the upcoming company movie night. These choices are stored in the file Employee_Movie_Choices.txt.
A second file, Employee_Relationships.txt, has data on the relationships between different coworkers.
The relationship score has value of -100 (Enemies) to +100 (Best Friends). A value of zero means the two employees haven't interacted or are indifferent.
Both files are tab delimited.

    else:
        nx.draw_networkx(G, pos, edges=edges);

Using NetworkX, load in the bipartite graph from Employee_Movie_Choices.txt and return that graph.

def answer_one():
        
    G = nx.read_edgelist('Employee_Movie_Choices.txt', delimiter="\t")
    
Using the graph from the previous question, add nodes attributes named 'type' where movies have the value 'movie' and employees have the value 'employee' and return that graph.    

def answer_two():
    
    G = answer_one()
    for node in G.nodes():
        if node in employees:
            G.add_node(node, type="employee")
        else:
            G.add_node(node, type="movie")
    return G
    
Find a weighted projection of the graph from answer_two which tells us how many movies different pairs of employees have in common.

def answer_three():
        
    B = answer_two()
    weighted_projection = bipartite.weighted_projected_graph(B, employees)
    
    return weighted_projection
    
Suppose you'd like to find out if people that have a high relationship score also like the same types of movies.
Find the Pearson correlation ( using DataFrame.corr() ) between employee relationship scores and the number of movies they have in common. If two employees have no movies in common it should be treated as a 0, not a missing value, and should be included in the correlation calculation.    

def answer_four():
        
    Rel = nx.read_edgelist('Employee_Relationships.txt', data=[('relationship_score', int)])
    Rel_df = pd.DataFrame(Rel.edges(data=True), columns=['From', 'To', 'relationship_score'])
#     print (Rel_df)
    G = answer_three()
    G_df = pd.DataFrame(G.edges(data=True), columns=['From', 'To', 'movies_score'])
#     print (G_df)
    G_copy_df = G_df.copy()
#     change the edge direction and get a double direction graph
    G_copy_df.rename(columns={"From":"From_", "To":"From"}, inplace=True)
    G_copy_df.rename(columns={"From_":"To"}, inplace=True)
#     print (G_copy_df)
    G_final_df = pd.concat([G_df, G_copy_df])
#     print (G_final_df)
    final_df = pd.merge(G_final_df, Rel_df, on = ['From', 'To'], how='right')
    final_df['movies_score'] = final_df['movies_score'].map(lambda x: x['weight'] if type(x)==dict else None)
    final_df['relationship_score'] = final_df['relationship_score'].map(lambda x: x['relationship_score'])
    final_df['movies_score'].fillna(value=0, inplace=True)
#     print (final_df)

    return final_df['movies_score'].corr(final_df['relationship_score'])
